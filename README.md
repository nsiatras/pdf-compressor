# PDF Compressor

This is an open source application for bulk compression of PDF files.<br>

I decided to create this application after spending a weekend trying to find some free or paid software that can bulk compress PDF files. 
Most of the software I found googling was full of bloatware or didn't work properly, so I decided to create my own using Java and the GhostScript binaries.
